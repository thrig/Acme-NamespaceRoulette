This module does nothing (except for screw around with AUTOLOAD, which might
well break anything that depends on that), unless a typo is made with a
function name, in which case some random other thingy from the symbol table is
instead called.

Install from CPAN via:

  cpan Acme::NamespaceRoulette

Or build and install from source via:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install
